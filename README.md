This is the analysis of an experiment in Psychology with multiple measures. 

**Experiment summary**
The main gist is that participants were presented with options of fine art images to choose from.
After the participants chose one of the options they saw a video of someone else making a choice. 
The confederates who made the choice either mimicked the participant's choice or not. Or they
only mimicked the motor movement of the participant, i.e. they chose a different option but with the same hand. 
The control condition was motor or choice mimicking in 50-50 ratio. 

Multiple measures after the choice task measured the closeness and affect of each participant towards
the confederates. The main hypotheses is that there would be a difference between the affect of participants
influenced by the different types of mimicking. 

**Analysis summary** 
R files contain the analysis pipeline which starts with load_data.R 
and continues with visualisations and the appropriate statistical tests on each hypotheses.
